# Nature-Inspired Algorithms for Time Series Numerical Association Rule Mining

## Overview

This project implements a system for **association rule mining in time series** using **nature-inspired algorithms**. The software allows for the extraction of meaningful rules from time series data, incorporating various metrics such as **support**, **confidence**, **inclusion**, and **amplitude**.


## Features

- **Time Series Association Rule Mining**: Handles time series data, allowing extraction of association rules based on numeric attributes.
- **Support, Confidence, and Inclusion Metrics**: Calculates standard metrics for rule evaluation, including a custom **inclusion metric** based on shared attributes between antecedents and consequents.
- **Nature-Inspired Optimization Algorithms**: Implements various algorithms to search for optimal association rules in large datasets.
- **Flexible and Scalable**: Supports dynamic loading of datasets and flexible feature analysis for any time series data.
