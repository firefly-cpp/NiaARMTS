NiaARMTS
========

This framework is designed for numerical association rule mining in time series data using stochastic population-based nature-inspired algorithms. It provides tools to extract association rules from time series datasets while incorporating key metrics such as support, confidence, inclusion, and amplitude. Although independent from the NiaARM framework, this software can be viewed as an extension, with additional support for time series numerical association rule mining.

Features
~~~~~~~~

The current version of the framework supports two types of time series numerical association rule mining:

- Fixed Interval Time Series Numerical Association Rule Mining
- Segmented Interval Time Series Numerical Association Rule Mining
